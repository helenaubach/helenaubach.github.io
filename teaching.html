Teaching </h2></p>

<p>
I have been teaching at different levels of knowledge. Preparing a <a href=#teaching-golferichs>gravitational-wave course</a> (outreach level) at Casa Golferichs Civic Center has helped me learn and get some experience. At the University, I have delivered lectures at <a href=#teaching-university-undergraduate>undergraduate level</a>, at <a href=#teaching-university-senior>courses for senior citizens</a> (outreach level) and at <a href=#teaching-high-school-workshops>high school workshops</a> (outreach level).

<p>
I designed and prepared a gravitational-wave course at the <a href="https://serviastro.ub.edu/en/activities/courses/course-gravitational-waves-a-new-window-universe" target="_blank">Casa Golferichs Civic Center</a> (Barcelona). 
</p>

<p>At the time (2022), all reference gravitational wave courses were at a very advanced mathematical level. On the other hand, outreach talks on the topic were short and general. It was a challenging experience to develop course materials suitable both for those who knew nothing about the topic and for those who had read all available outreach about the topic, some of them with Physics and Engineering backgrounds.
I created a syllabus from scratch, dividing the course into:
</p>
<p>
<ul style="none">
  <li> Introduction (2h)</li>
  <li> Formation and properties of gravitational waves (6h)</li>
  <li> Sources of gravitational waves (6h) </li>
  <li> Detection of gravitational waves. Present observations. Future missions and prospects (6h) </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The idea was keeping a level where everyone could follow, while trying to keep information-avid students engaged with the newest (non-confidential) results. After class, some students asked more in-depth details and we stayed for  discussions.

<p>
I have been teaching an undergraduate course on introductory physics for first-year engineering students. Specifically, the course "Fundamentals of Waves, Fluids and Thermodynamics" for the BSc "Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering" at the University of Barcelona.
</p>

<p>
My main responsability has been teaching how to solve the problems and exercises (once a week). </p>

<p>
I am involved in some lectures of the courses organized by the University of Barcelona (<i>Universitat de l'Experi&egrave;ncia, Gaudir UB</i>) aimed at senior students. 
</p>

<p>
The experience is similar to the course in Casa Golferichs Civic Center, with the difference that in this case the content of my lectures is part of a larger syllabus, prepared from previous years.
</p>

<p>
Additionally to the classroom lectures, we have also done practical astronomical observations (with portable telescopes) and visited astronomical facilities (<a href="https://parcastronomic.cat/en/" target="_blank">Observatori del Montsec</a>).

</h3>
In these workshops organized by the Faculty of Physics (<i>Experiments de F&iacute;sica, Campus Physis</i>), we combined short lectures with practical demonstrations: a virtual tour across the Milky Way, observations of the Sun with a protected telescope and real-time detection of radioactive particles.
